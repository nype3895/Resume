Portfolio Website
I attempted to create a portfolio website using Claude.ai. While the AI-generated design provided a good starting point, I encountered several functionality issues that prevented the site from working as intended.

Positive Outcomes

Color and Layout Success – The website’s colors came out exactly as I envisioned, and I was satisfied with the overall layout.
Issues Encountered

Navigation Failure – The buttons designed to navigate between pages did not function properly. Clicking them caused the site to freeze.
Error Messages – Instead of transitioning to the next page, the website displayed an error message and became unresponsive.
Sketch Upload Issue – I initially tried to upload my own sketch to describe myself, but it did not convert correctly. As a result, I opted to let the AI generate an image based on my resume instead.
